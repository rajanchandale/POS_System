A POS System designed for an Indian Street Food Stall

This POS System was designed for a family-friend who has just recently opened up a food stall specialising in North Indian Street Food. He is currently only accepting cash payment and the system has been designed to reflect this. However, I am looking forward to being able to integrate a card payment interface. 

The current functionalities of the system allow users to record any given customers order using the food menu prompts whilst also calculating the total of the transaction and the required change amount. Records of each and every transaction are stored as receipts and in a relational SQL database. An analytics section has also been provided which will run a series of personalised queries to provide information on the performance of various menu items along with being able to return past receipts.
